## 🔧 3. Setting Up VS Code for Web Development

Now let’s make VS Code ready for HTML & web development.

### 🧩 Recommended Extensions
Install these extensions (search them in the Extensions tab):
- **Live Server** — instantly preview your webpage in a browser  
- **Prettier - Code Formatter** — auto-formats your code  
- **HTML CSS Support** — improves HTML & CSS autocompletion  

### 📂 Folder Setup
Create a folder on your system, for example:

- NextGen-Web-Course/
└── Day01/
- Open that folder in VS Code (`File → Open Folder`).

---

## 💻 4. Creating Your First HTML File

Inside your folder, create a new file named `index.html`.

Paste the following code 👇  

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, Web Developers!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the NextGen Web Development Course.</p>
</body>
</html>

▶️ Run the Page

Right-click the file and select “Open with Live Server”

Your browser should display:

Hello, Web Developers!
Welcome to the NextGen Web Development Course.

🧠 5. Understanding HTML Structure
Section	Tag	Description
<!DOCTYPE html>	—	Declares that the document is HTML5
<html>	Root element	Wraps all content
<head>	Metadata	Contains title, charset, and links
<body>	Content	Visible part of the webpage
<h1>	Heading	Used for main titles
<p>	Paragraph	Used for text content
🧩 6. Practice Task (Do It Yourself)

Create another file named about.html
and try to build your own personal intro page.

📝 Requirements:

Add your name as a main heading (<h1>)

Write a short paragraph about yourself (<p>)

Add a line like “Contact me at your@email.com
”

Example:

<h1>John Doe</h1>
<p>I am learning web development with RaptorXCode.</p>
<p>Contact me at johndoe@email.com</p>


Run it using Live Server and check your result!

💡 7. Pro Tips

Always name your main file index.html (it loads first by default).

Use Prettier to keep your code neat and readable.

Save your work frequently using Ctrl + S or Cmd + S.

Practice daily — consistency is the real key to mastery.
